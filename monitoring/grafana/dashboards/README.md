# Grafana Dashboards

Eight ready-to-use Grafana dashboards for the Prometheus Slurm Exporter.
All dashboards are compatible with **Grafana 12+** and use a `$datasource`
template variable for portability.

## Import

**Option 1 — Grafana UI:** Go to **Dashboards → Import**, paste a JSON file or upload it directly.

**Option 2 — Provisioning** (recommended for permanent setup):

```bash
cp monitoring/grafana/dashboards/*.json /etc/grafana/provisioning/dashboards/
# Reload Grafana or wait for the provisioning interval (default: 30s)
```

**Option 3 — API** (batch import):

```bash
for f in monitoring/grafana/dashboards/*.json; do
  curl -s -X POST http://admin:password@grafana-host:3000/api/dashboards/db \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"dashboard\": $(cat "$f"), \"overwrite\": true, \"folderId\": 0}"
done
```

### 3. Node Detail

**File:** `03-slurm-nodes.json` | **UID:** `slurm-nodes`

Per-node CPU and memory utilization. **Designed to scale from small clusters
to 100k+ nodes** via a `$partition` filter variable.

| CPU Allocated per Node (top 10) | timeseries | Most loaded nodes over time |
| Memory Allocated per Node (top 10) | timeseries | Top memory consumers |

> **Scale note:** The per-node detail table is filtered by the `$partition` variable.
> On clusters with 100k+ nodes, always select a specific partition to limit results.
> The partition summary and "Down & Drain Nodes" panels are always O(partitions).

### 7. Accounting *(new in v1.7.0)*

**File:** `07-slurm-accounting.json` | **UID:** `slurm-accounting`

Filter by `$account` and `$user` template variables.

### 9. Exporter Performance *(new in v1.8.0)*

**File:** `09-slurm-exporter-perf.json` | **UID:** `slurm-exporter-perf`

Internal performance dashboard for the exporter itself. Use this to validate
that optimisations work and to detect slowdowns before they cause scrape failures.

| Panel | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Collectors OK / FAIL / Total Errors | stat | Scrape health indicators |
| scontrol Cache Age | stat | Should oscillate 0-25s — flat at TTL = problem |

| Call Count per Command | bargauge | sinfo should be ~1/scrape after Axe 2 |
| Command Duration p99 + avg | timeseries | Latency spikes = slurmctld overload |

| scontrol Cache Age Over Time | timeseries | Cache hit/miss pattern |
| sacct Refresh Age | timeseries | sacct_efficiency staleness |

## Generating Screenshots

Screenshots are generated using Playwright in a Docker container:

```bash
# Prerequisite: Grafana running on localhost:3000
./scripts/take_screenshots.sh /tmp/screenshots
```

Or manually:

```bash
GSESSION=$(curl -s -D - -X POST http://localhost:3000/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user":"admin","password":"admin"}' \
  | grep 'grafana_session=' | grep -v expiry \
  | sed 's/.*grafana_session=\([^;]*\).*/\1/' | tr -d '\r\n')

docker run --rm --network slurm_slurm-network \
  -e "GSESSION=$GSESSION" -e "LANG=en_US.UTF-8" \
  -v /tmp/screenshots:/screenshots -w /work \
  mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.51.1-noble \
  bash -c 'npm i -y playwright@1.51.1 > /dev/null && node script.js'
```

See [`scripts/take_screenshots.sh`](../scripts/take_screenshots.sh) for the full script.
### 10. All Metrics Reference

**File:** `10-slurm-all-metrics.json` | **UID:** `slurm-all-metrics`

An exhaustive reference dashboard showing **every metric** exported by the
Slurm Exporter, organized by collector. Useful for:
- Discovering available metrics
- Debugging queries
- Validating that all collectors are working

115 panels covering all 14 collectors (+ new v1.8 metrics):
`accounts`, `cpus`, `fairshare`, `gpus`, `info`, `licenses`, `node`, `nodes`,
`partitions`, `queue`, `reservation_nodes`, `reservations`, `scheduler`, `users`

> This dashboard is intentionally dense. Use the other focused dashboards for
> daily monitoring. This one is a reference/debug tool.
