## [1.8.2] - 2026-05-11

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- **`scheduler` collector — `slurm_scheduler_jobs_*_total` renamed and
  retyped (issue #22, PR #23 by @UeliDeSchwert):**
  The five sdiag-derived counters introduced in v1.8.0 were declared as
  `prometheus.CounterValue` but `sdiag` resets these values to zero on
  every `slurmctld` restart or `scontrol reconfigure`. A Counter that
  decreases violates the Prometheus data model and breaks `rate()` /
  `increase()` at the reset boundary. The `_total` suffix is also
  reserved for Counters by Prometheus naming conventions.

  | Old (Counter) | New (Gauge) |
  | --- | --- |
  | `slurm_scheduler_jobs_submitted_total` | `slurm_scheduler_jobs_submitted` |
  | `slurm_scheduler_jobs_started_total`   | `slurm_scheduler_jobs_started` |
  | `slurm_scheduler_jobs_completed_total` | `slurm_scheduler_jobs_completed` |
  | `slurm_scheduler_jobs_canceled_total`  | `slurm_scheduler_jobs_canceled` |
  | `slurm_scheduler_jobs_failed_total`    | `slurm_scheduler_jobs_failed` |

  **Migration:**
  - Replace the metric names in any external dashboards / recording rules /
    alerts.
  - Drop any `rate()` or `increase()` wrappers — these were already
    producing incorrect results across slurmctld restarts. Use the raw
    Gauge value (cumulative since last reset) or `deriv()` for a
    short-window throughput estimate.
  - Help text on each metric documents the reset behavior.

  Rationale for shipping this in a patch release: the metrics were only
  introduced six weeks ago (v1.8.0, 2026-04-02), shipped in two releases
  (v1.8.0 and v1.8.1), are not referenced in any in-repo dashboard, and
  had a real correctness bug under any non-trivial cluster reconfigure.
  The disruption window is small and the longer the broken Counter ships,
  the more downstream consumers we'd break later.

  The `dashboards_grafana/05-slurm-scheduler.json` dashboard ships in this
  release with a new **"Job Lifecycle (since slurmctld start)"** row
  exposing the five renamed metrics — the first in-repo visualisation
  of these counters.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **`node` collector — long node names silently dropped (issue #10):**
  `sinfo -O "NodeList,..."` uses fixed-width columns (default 20 chars for
  `NodeList`). On clusters with node hostnames longer than 20 characters, the
  `NodeList` column collided with `AllocMem`, leaving lines with only 5
  whitespace-separated tokens instead of 6. The parser silently skipped them
  (`if len(node) < 6 { continue }`), causing entire nodes to disappear from the
  metrics map — and the collector reported success (no error, non-zero
  `slurm_exporter_collector_duration_seconds`) while exposing zero
  `slurm_node_*` series. Fixed by switching to variable-width columns
  (`NodeList: ,AllocMem: ,...`); the trailing `:` instructs `sinfo` to size
  each column to its value. The parser itself is unchanged.
  Regression was introduced when `slurm_node_status` was added; the original
  2022 fix for the same class of bug (commit `77080e0`) was inadvertently
  reverted at that point.

- **`reservations` collector — phantom row when no reservations defined
  (issue #26):**
  `parseReservations` processed every non-empty record from
  `scontrol show reservation`, including the literal `"No reservations in
  the system"` line that scontrol emits on an empty cluster. With no
  key=value to parse, every field stayed at its zero value and the
  record was still appended — producing a phantom series:

  ```
  slurm_reservation_info{reservation_name="",...} 1
  slurm_reservation_start_time_seconds{reservation_name=""} -6.21355968e+10
  slurm_reservation_end_time_seconds{reservation_name=""} -6.21355968e+10
  ```

  The `-6.21e+10` timestamp is `time.Time{}.Unix() = -62135596800`
  (year 0001), which Grafana renders as `1968-01-12 20:06:43` on the
  reservations dashboard.

  Fixed by skipping records that didn't yield a `ReservationName`. Empty
  clusters now produce zero `slurm_reservation_*` series; dashboards
  show "No data" instead of a fake 1968 reservation. Non-regression test
  added with a `sreservations_empty.txt` fixture.
- **`scheduler` collector — RPC usernames with hyphens silently truncated
  (PR #28 by @ncreddine):**
  `schedulerRPCLineRe` used the character class `[A-Za-z0-9_]*` for the
  username capture group, which silently dropped the hyphen. Usernames
  like `alice-21` were truncated to `alice`, collapsing every per-user RPC
  stat onto the prefix and hiding per-user breakdowns in
  `slurm_user_rpc_stats_*`. Extended the class to `[A-Za-z0-9_-]*`.
  Table-driven non-regression test added.
- **`accounts` collector — `gres:gpu:N` (colon separator) not parsed
  (PR #28 by @ncreddine):**
  `tresGPURe` matched only the slash form `gres/gpu:N` from `squeue %b`
  output. Some Slurm versions emit `gres:gpu:N` (colon prefix) which fell
  through to a count of 0, undercounting `slurm_account_cores_gpu` and
  `slurm_user_cores_gpu` on those clusters. Broadened the prefix to
  `gres[:/]gpu`. Existing slash-form tests still pass; four colon-form
  cases added.
- **Startup fails if `sbatch`/`salloc`/`srun` are absent (issue #24, PR #25 by
  @UeliDeSchwert):**
  `ValidateBinaries()` required `sbatch`, `salloc`, and `srun` in addition to
  the Slurm monitoring tools actually used by the exporter. These three
  job-submission binaries are never invoked by any collector and are often
  absent on read-only monitoring containers or minimal Slurm client
  installations, causing the exporter to refuse to start with
  `--slurm.bin-path` set. They are now removed from the required list.
  Companion follow-up below restores informational visibility.

### ✨ Improvements

- **`slurm_info` collector — expose job submission tool versions when
  available:**
  Following the issue #24 fix that dropped `sbatch`/`salloc`/`srun` from the
  strict startup validation, they are now reintroduced in the `slurm_info`
  collector as **silent optionals**: emitted only when present on the host,
  with no log entry or metric when absent. Lookup uses `os.Stat` against
  `--slurm.bin-path` (or `exec.LookPath` against `$PATH` when empty),
  avoiding any subprocess spawn. Required binaries continue to emit a
  `slurm_info{binary="X",version="not_found"}` series with value `0` when
  missing, so operators can still alert on their absence.

- **`partitions` collector — default partition `*` suffix not stripped
  (issue #20, PR #21 by @UeliDeSchwert):**
  Slurm appends `*` to the default partition name in `sinfo` output
  (e.g. `compute*`). The `nodes` collector already strips this suffix
  (`nodes.go:169`), but `partitions.go` did not, producing
  `slurm_partition_cpus_*` and `slurm_partition_gpus_*` with
  `partition="compute*"` while every other metric used `partition="compute"`.
  PromQL joins on the partition label silently returned no data for the
  default partition. Fixed by applying the same `strings.TrimRight(..., "*")`
  in both the CPU path and the GPU path; two unit tests verify the
  asterisk-suffixed input is stored under the bare key.
- **`queue` collector — same `*` suffix bug, defensive companion fix:**
  `squeue -o "%P"` emits `compute*` for the default partition on some
  Slurm versions; the queue collector now applies the same
  `TrimRight(..., "*")` so `slurm_queue_*` and `slurm_cores_*` labels
  stay aligned with the partitions and nodes collectors.
  Non-regression test added.
- **`sacct_efficiency` collector — graceful shutdown on SIGTERM/SIGINT
  (issue #18, PR #19 by @UeliDeSchwert):**
  The background refresh goroutine was started with `context.Background()`,
  which is never cancelled. On SIGTERM/SIGINT, the HTTP server stopped but
  the goroutine — possibly mid-`sacct` invocation — was only terminated
  when the OS killed the process. Now wired through `signal.NotifyContext`,
  so the context is cancelled cleanly on signal. The main loop also waits
  up to 5 seconds for the goroutine to exit (via the new `Done()` channel)
  before returning, so any in-flight `sacct` call has a chance to complete.
  Non-regression test added (`TestSacctEfficiencyCollector_DoneClosesOnCancel`).
- **`gpus` collector — `slurm_gpus_other` can be negative on busy clusters
  (issue #16, PR #17 by @UeliDeSchwert):**
  `other` is computed as `total − allocated − idle`, where each value comes
  from a separate `sinfo` invocation. Cluster state can change between the
  three calls, transiently producing `alloc + idle > total` and a negative
  gauge — which Grafana renders incorrectly. Clamped to zero with a Debug
  log when the clamp triggers (useful for diagnosing suspected miscounting
  without spamming production logs, since the race is common on loaded
  clusters). A follow-up issue tracks the proper fix: consolidate the three
  `sinfo` calls into one to eliminate the race at the source.
- **`sacct_efficiency` collector — memory efficiency average understated
  (issue #14, PR #15 by @UeliDeSchwert):**
  `slurm_job_mem_efficiency_avg` accumulated the per-job ratio only when
  `ReqMemMB > 0` (correct) but divided by `JobCount` — the total number of
  jobs, including those without memory requests. On a cluster where half the
  jobs are submitted without `--mem`, the reported average was half the real
  value. Same structural pattern fixed for `slurm_job_cpu_efficiency_avg`
  (lower impact in practice). Fixed by adding `CPUJobCount` and `MemJobCount`
  to the aggregates struct and dividing by the per-metric counter. Affected
  sites will see both averages rise to their correct value after upgrade.
  Non-regression test added.
- **`queue` collector — `slurm_queue_suspended` and `slurm_cores_suspended`
  never emitted (issue #12, PR #13 by @UeliDeSchwert):**
  Both metrics were declared, described, and populated by `ParseQueueMetrics`,
  but `Collect()` was missing the `PushMetric` / `pushAggregatedNVal` calls
  for them — every scrape silently dropped these series. The global
  `slurm_jobs_suspended` gauge was unaffected. Fixed by adding the four
  missing calls (two in the per-user branch, two in the aggregated branch).
  Non-regression test added.
- **`partitions` collector — multi-type GPU undercount:**
  `parseGpuCount()` in `partitions.go` used `FindStringSubmatch` (singular),
  returning only the first `gpu:*:N` match in a GRES string. On nodes
  exposing multiple GPU types (`gpu:A100:4,gpu:H100:2`),
  `slurm_partition_gpus_allocated` and `slurm_partition_gpus_idle` were
  silently undercounted (returned 4 instead of 6). Fixed by iterating over
  comma-separated GRES sub-specs and accumulating, matching the
  long-correct behavior of `gpus.go::parseGPUCount`. Cluster-wide
  `slurm_gpus_*` was not affected. Affected sites will see
  `slurm_partition_gpus_*` values increase to their real count after
  upgrade.

### 🛡️ Defensive hardening

- **`partitions` collector — fixed-width truncation of GRES strings:**
  `sinfo --Format=...Gres:50,GresUsed:50` truncates rich GRES specs on busy
  GPU nodes (multi-type GPUs, MIG slices) at 50 chars, producing wrong GPU
  counts in `slurm_partition_gpus_*`. Same class of bug as the `node`
  collector issue. Switched to variable-width (`Gres: ,GresUsed:`).
- **`gpus` collector — fixed-width truncation of GRES strings:**
  Same fix applied to `IdleGPUsData()` and `TotalGPUsData()`. `AllocatedGPUsData()`
  was already correct.
- **Empty-parse warning logs:** `node` and `partitions` collectors now emit a
  warning when the parser returns zero entries despite the underlying command
  succeeding. This makes the failure mode from issue #10 fail loudly instead
  of silently — operators see the warning instead of staring at "No data"
  dashboards with no clue why.
- **Data race in `sacct_efficiency` test fixed; `Done()` channel added.**
  `TestSacctEfficiencyCollector_ErrorKeepsPreviousCache` had two races caught
  by `go test -race`: an unprotected `callCount++` in the mock closure, and
  the test's `defer Execute = oldExecute` racing with the background refresh
  goroutine still reading `Execute`. Counter now uses `atomic.Int64`, and
  `SacctEfficiencyCollector` exposes a new `Done() <-chan struct{}` channel
  that closes when the background goroutine exits — letting tests
  synchronise teardown deterministically. Production behavior unchanged.

### 📊 Dashboard impact

No dashboard JSON changes — metric names, labels, and types are unchanged.
However, **clusters previously affected by silent truncation will see metric
values increase** as the missing series reappear:

- `slurm_node_*` series for nodes with hostnames > 20 chars will now be exposed
  (previously absent), so `count`/`sum` queries over them will rise to their
  real values.
- `slurm_partition_*` series for partitions with names > 30 chars will now
  appear under their full name; series previously stored under a truncated
  partition name will disappear.
- `slurm_gpus_*` and `slurm_partition_gpus_*` will reflect the true GPU
  inventory on nodes with rich GRES specs (multi-type GPU, MIG).

The `or vector(0)` guards added to dashboards in v1.8.1 remain valid (they
protect against legitimately empty states) and require no rework.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-04-28

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Dashboards — empty node states no longer break panels:** `count()` over an empty
  vector returns no samples (not `0`) in PromQL, so `count(stateA) + count(stateB)`
  silently returned "No data" whenever either side was empty. Six expressions in
  `slurm-overview` and `slurm-usage` (Active, Down+Drain, Node %, Avg Node %,
  Allocated+Completing) rewritten to use a single regex
  (`status=~"alloc.*|mix.*"`) — also avoids double-counting nodes that appear
  in multiple partitions. Plus 43 isolated `count(slurm_node_status{...})` panels
  now use `or vector(0)` so empty states render as `0` instead of "No data".

- **Multi-partition clusters — node state metrics double-counted:** nodes belonging
  to multiple partitions were counted once per partition. Fixed by adding
  `count by(node)` deduplication.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-03-31

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **`slurm-accounting` dashboard — Active Users/Accounts "No data":** `count(metric > 0)` returns an empty result set in PromQL when no series match, causing stat panels to show "No data" instead of `0`. Fixed with `or vector(0)` fallback.
- **Dashboards — percentage formatting:** All `percent`/`percentunit` panels without explicit decimal settings now display 1 decimal place (e.g. `87.5%` instead of `87.54321%`). FairShare panels reduced from 3 to 1 decimal. 21 fixes across `slurm-accounting`, `slurm-all-metrics` and `slurm-usage` dashboards.
- **`accounts.go` / TRES GPU regex:** Extended char class from `[:/]` to `[:/=]` to handle the rare `gres/gpu=N` format (equals sign instead of colon).
- **`scheduler.go` — DBD Agent regex:** Tightened `^DBD Agent` to `^DBD Agent queue size` to prevent future sdiag fields from accidentally overwriting the queue size value.

### 📋 Documentation

- **`docs/audit-v1.7.md`:** Full audit report (395 lines) covering all 4 axes — command/format validation against Slurm 25.11, parser quality, missing metrics analysis (sacct efficiency, sstat, sinfo %E/%H), and PromQL review of all 9 dashboards. No breaking issues found. v1.8 backlog defined.
- Dashboard screenshots refreshed on 20-node live cluster with real user activity.

---

## [1.7.0] - 2026-03-30

### ✨ Features

- **Enhanced `fairshare` collector** (from community PR #6 by @franky920920, improved):
  - New per-user metrics: `slurm_user_fairshare{account,user}`, `slurm_user_fairshare_raw_shares`, `slurm_user_fairshare_norm_shares`, `slurm_user_fairshare_raw_usage_cpu_seconds`, `slurm_user_fairshare_norm_usage`
  - New per-account metrics: `slurm_account_fairshare_raw_shares`, `slurm_account_fairshare_norm_shares`, `slurm_account_fairshare_raw_usage_cpu_seconds`, `slurm_account_fairshare_norm_usage`
  - Enables answering "Why is this user's priority low?" directly in Grafana by comparing `norm_usage` vs `norm_shares`
  - `RawUsage` metric renamed to `raw_usage_cpu_seconds` for clarity (CPU-seconds, decay-weighted)

- **`--collector.fairshare.user-metrics` flag** (default `true`): Disable per-user fairshare metrics on clusters with many users to control cardinality. Each user generates 5 additional time series.

- **New `slurm-accounting` Grafana dashboard:** Dedicated HPC accounting dashboard with:
  - User FairShare summary table (FairShare factor, NormShares, NormUsage, Usage/Shares ratio, CPU-seconds)
  - Top consumers by running jobs, CPUs, and accounts
  - Priority ranking: users sorted by FairShare ascending (lowest priority first)
  - Account summary table with historical CPU usage
  - Usage trends: running jobs and CPUs per user and account over time
  - FairShare evolution timeseries per user and account
  - Filterable by `$account` and `$user` variables

- **`slurm-usage` dashboard updated** with two new user-level FairShare panels.

### 🧪 Tests & Quality

- **Coverage: 41% → 57%** — 6 new test files added:
  - `fairshare_test.go`: 15 tests — parser edge cases (empty account, parent skip, indented lines), Execute mock, full Collect/Describe coverage, deduplication guard, error handling, user-metrics flag
  - `users_test.go`: parser + collector tests (previously 0% coverage)
  - `status_test.go`: StatusTracker Add/Collect/Describe/panic-recovery (previously 0%)
  - `accounts_collector_test.go`, `licenses_collector_test.go`, `cpus_collector_test.go`: collector-level tests via Execute mock
  - `test_data/sshare_users.txt`: anonymized `sshare -a` fixture

- **Lint:** 0 issues (gofmt, goimports, golangci-lint v2)

---

## [1.6.0] - 2026-03-22

### ✨ Features

- **Global job metrics always present:** All `slurm_jobs_*` cluster-wide counters (`slurm_jobs_running`, `slurm_jobs_pending`, `slurm_jobs_completing`, `slurm_jobs_failed`, `slurm_jobs_timeout`, `slurm_jobs_cancelled`, `slurm_jobs_preempted`, `slurm_jobs_node_fail`, `slurm_jobs_suspended`, `slurm_jobs_cores_running`, `slurm_jobs_cores_pending`) are now **always emitted** — even when the cluster has zero jobs — so alerting rules never encounter missing time series.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **StatusTracker deadlock on large clusters:** The previous implementation used a 512-slot intermediate channel between the inner collector and the Prometheus registry. On clusters with high metric cardinality (200+ nodes × partitions × metrics > 512), the inner collector blocked waiting for channel capacity while the goroutine draining the channel was waiting for it to finish — a classic deadlock. Fixed by writing directly to the Prometheus channel inside the collector goroutine, eliminating the intermediate buffer entirely.

---

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-22

### ✨ Features

- **`--slurm.bin-path` flag:** Configure the directory where Slurm binaries (`sinfo`, `squeue`, `sdiag`, `scontrol`, `sshare`, etc.) are looked up. Defaults to empty (system `$PATH`). Required when running in environments where Slurm is not on `$PATH` (e.g. containers with host-mounted binaries, non-standard installations).

  Fatal startup validation: when `--slurm.bin-path` is set, the exporter checks that every required binary exists and is executable at boot. Missing or non-executable binaries are reported individually and the process exits with code 1 — fail fast with a clear message rather than silently returning empty metrics.

  ```bash
  ./slurm_exporter --slurm.bin-path=/opt/slurm/bin
  ```

- **`--collector.queue.user-label` flag** (default `true`): Disable the `user` label on all `slurm_queue_*` and `slurm_cores_*` metrics. When disabled, job counts are aggregated per partition only. On clusters with many users this dramatically reduces cardinality: 1 000 users × 10 partitions × 22 metrics = ~220 000 series → ~220 series.

- **Metrics output examples:** New [`docs/metrics-examples.md`](docs/metrics-examples.md) with representative Prometheus text-format output for all 14 collectors. Includes before/after comparisons for `--collector.nodes.feature-set`, `--collector.queue.user-label`, and `--web.disable-exporter-metrics`.

### ⚙️ Technical Improvements

- **CI upgraded to Node.js 24 actions** (ahead of the June 2, 2026 GitHub enforcement deadline):
  - `actions/checkout` v4 → v6
  - `actions/setup-go` v5 → v6
  - `goreleaser/goreleaser-action` v6 → v7
  - `golangci/golangci-lint-action` v8 → v9

- **`--slurm.bin-path` test coverage:** 5 tests covering custom path execution, missing binary, non-executable binary, and the skip-validation behaviour when path is empty (fake shell scripts in `t.TempDir()`).

- **Queue cardinality test coverage:** `TestPushAggregatedNVal` and `TestPushAggregatedNNVal` verify the aggregation logic for `--no-collector.queue.user-label`.

---

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-21

### ✨ Features

- **GPU metrics per account and user:** New `slurm_account_gpus_running{account}` and `slurm_user_gpus_running{user}` metrics tracking running GPUs from the TRES field (`%b`) of `squeue`. Correctly multiplies per-node GPU count by the number of allocated nodes for multi-node jobs.
- **Reserved license metric:** New `slurm_license_reserved{license}` metric exposing the `Reserved` field from `scontrol show licenses`. The parser also now handles the complete real-world output format including `Remote`, `LastConsumed`, `LastDeficit`, and `LastUpdate` fields.
- **Reservation nodes collector:** New `reservation_nodes` collector providing per-reservation node state metrics from `scontrol show nodes -o`. Handles compound Slurm states (e.g. `ALLOCATED+MAINTENANCE+RESERVED`) by categorising on the primary state (token before the first `+`). Metrics: `slurm_reservation_nodes_{alloc,idle,mix,down,drain,planned,other,healthy}{reservation}`.
- **`--collector.nodes.feature-set` flag** (default `true`): Disable the `active_feature_set` label on `slurm_nodes_*` metrics to reduce cardinality on homogeneous clusters where feature sets add no monitoring value.
- **`--web.disable-exporter-metrics` flag** (default `false`): Exclude Go runtime and process metrics (`go_goroutines`, `process_cpu_seconds_total`, etc.) from `/metrics`. Useful when a dedicated Go runtime exporter is already scraping the host.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **GPU sinfo column overflow:** `--Format=Nodes: ,GresUsed:` used only 1 character of padding between columns. On clusters with 1000+ node groups (e.g. `1056gpu:...`), the Nodes and GresUsed columns merged into a single unparseable token. Fixed by adding explicit column widths (`Nodes:10`, `Gres:50`, `GresUsed:50`) in `gpus.go` and `partitions.go`.
- **Queue parser truncation:** The squeue format changed from `%P,%T,%C,%r,%u` to `%P|%T|%C|%r|%u` (pipe delimiter). Pending reasons often contain commas (e.g. `Resources,Priority`) which silently truncated the reason field and shifted all subsequent fields.
- **StatusTracker panic on startup:** The previous `WrapWithStatus` approach registered one `StatusCollector` per Slurm collector. All instances tried to register the same `*prometheus.Desc` objects (different pointers, same fqName), causing a panic on boot. Replaced with a single `StatusTracker` that internally runs all collectors and emits health metrics from one canonical descriptor pair.

### ⚙️ Technical Improvements

- **`strings.SplitSeq` modernization:** Replaced `strings.Split` with `strings.SplitSeq` (Go 1.24+) in all parse functions that iterate over lines without needing a sorted or indexed slice (`accounts`, `users`, `fairshare`, `licenses`, `queue`, `reservation_nodes`). Avoids allocating the full intermediate `[]string` slice on every `Collect()` call.
- **Real-world test data:** All new parsers are backed by anonymised real-world `scontrol`/`squeue` output from production clusters (`slurm-25.05` with `nvidia_gb200` GPUs, `scontrol show nodes` with compound states and reservation fields).

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-21

### ✨ Features

- **Custom Prometheus registry:** Replaced the default global registry with `prometheus.NewRegistry()`. Prevents metric pollution from third-party packages, makes the exposed metric set fully explicit, and enables OpenMetrics format.
- **OpenMetrics format:** `promhttp.HandlerFor` with `EnableOpenMetrics: true` — supports exemplars and newer Prometheus features.
- **GoCollector and ProcessCollector:** Go runtime and process metrics are now explicitly registered (`go_goroutines`, `go_gc_duration_seconds`, `process_cpu_seconds_total`, etc.).
- **`/healthz` endpoint:** Liveness probe returning `200 ok` without executing any Slurm commands. Allows Kubernetes and systemd to distinguish process liveness from Slurm reachability.
- **Per-collector health metrics:** `slurm_exporter_collector_success{collector}` (1=success, 0=panic) and `slurm_exporter_collector_duration_seconds{collector}` for independent alerting on each Slurm collector.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Nil pointer dereference in `ParsePartitionsMetrics` (issue #5):** When a partition appeared in GPU sinfo output but not in the CPU partition map, accessing the nil pointer caused a `SIGSEGV`. Fixed by initialising the partition entry before the GPU accumulation. Regression test `TestParsePartitionsMetricsGPUOnlyPartition` added.
- **`slurm_cores_suspended` never populated:** Copy-paste bug in `ParseQueueMetrics` incremented `qm.suspended` twice instead of populating `qm.c_suspended`. The `slurm_cores_suspended` metric was silently always zero.
- **Bounds checks:** Added `len(splitted) < 4` guard in `ParseCPUsMetrics` and `len(cpuInfo) < 4` guard in `ParseNodeMetrics` to prevent index-out-of-range panics on unexpected `sinfo` output.
- **Scheduler colon truncation:** `strings.Split(line, ":")` in `ParseSchedulerMetrics` truncated values containing colons (e.g. timestamps like `"Wed Apr 12 11:03:21"`). Fixed with `strings.SplitN(line, ":", 2)`.
- **Reservation timezone:** `time.Parse` used UTC silently. Switched to `time.ParseInLocation(slurmTimeLayout, value, time.Local)` so `StartTime`/`EndTime` Unix timestamps reflect the Slurm server's actual local timezone.

### ♻️ Refactoring

- **Data/Parse pattern enforced:** `ParseFairShareMetrics` and `ParseUsersMetrics` previously fetched data inside the parse function, making them untestable in isolation. Both now follow the standard `Data() → Parse() → GetMetrics()` pattern.
- **`ParsePartitionsMetrics` decomposed:** Extracted three focused helpers (`parsePartitionCPUs`, `parsePartitionGPUs`, `parsePartitionJobs`) to reduce cyclomatic complexity from 19 to 6.
- **Regexes pre-compiled:** All `regexp.MustCompile` calls in `accounts`, `users`, `nodes`, `reservations`, and `scheduler` collectors moved to package-level variables to avoid recompilation on every `Collect()` call.
- **camelCase rename (ST1003):** All unexported struct fields and local variables renamed from `snake_case` to `camelCase` throughout the `collector` package.
- **`slices` package:** Replaced `sort.Strings` + `RemoveDuplicates` with `slices.Sort` + `slices.Compact` (Go 1.21+) in `nodes.go` and `node.go`. `RemoveDuplicates` function removed.
- **`appendUnique` modernised:** Replaced manual loop with `slices.Contains`.

### ⚙️ Technical Improvements

- **Go 1.25 / toolchain 1.26.1:** Updated `go.mod` from `go 1.22` to `go 1.25.0` with `toolchain go1.26.1`.
- **All dependencies updated:** `prometheus/client_golang` v1.20.4 → v1.23.2, `prometheus/exporter-toolkit` v0.11.0 → v0.15.1, `prometheus/common` v0.60.0 → v0.67.5, `stretchr/testify` v1.9.0 → v1.11.1, and all transitive dependencies.
- **Slowloris mitigation:** Added `ReadHeaderTimeout: 5s` to `http.Server` (gosec G112).
- **golangci-lint v2 config:** Added `.golangci.yml` with `gosec`, `staticcheck`, `errcheck`, `govet`, `revive`, `gocritic`, `misspell`, `bodyclose`, `whitespace`.
- **CI updated:** Go version 1.22 → 1.25 in both workflows; golangci-lint `v1.59` → `latest` (v2.11.3).
- **Test coverage:** Added assertions to `cpus`, `queue`, `scheduler` tests; added `TestParseCPUsMetricsMalformed` (5 edge cases); added `TestParsePartitionsMetricsGPUOnlyPartition` regression test for issue #5.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-03-21

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Nil pointer dereference in `ParsePartitionsMetrics` (issue #5):** Critical crash reproduced on Slurm 24.11.x (SUSE 15.6) and Slurm 25.11 (Ubuntu 24.04). When `sinfo --Format=Gres,GresUsed` returned a partition that was absent from the CPU `sinfo` output, accessing the nil map pointer caused a `SIGSEGV` at `partitions.go:117`. Fixed by initialising the map entry before access.
- **Bounds checks on `sinfo` CPU field:** Added `len(splitLine) < 2` and `len(statesSplit) < 4` guards in `ParsePartitionsMetrics` to handle truncated or malformed `sinfo` output without panicking.
- **Bounds checks on `squeue` fields:** Added `len(fields) < 4` guards in `ParseAccountsMetrics` and `ParseUsersMetrics` to handle incomplete squeue lines.
- **Bounds checks on `sshare` fields:** Added `len(fields) < 2` guard in `ParseFairShareMetrics`.
- **`slurm_cores_suspended` never populated:** Copy-paste bug: the second `qm.suspended.Incr(user, part, cores)` call should have been `qm.c_suspended.Incr(user, part, cores)`. The `slurm_cores_suspended` metric was silently always zero.

### ⚙️ Technical Improvements

- **Regression test:** Added `TestParsePartitionsMetricsGPUOnlyPartition` to prevent regressions of issue #5.
- **Merge of `fix/issue-5-crash-suse` branch:** The fix branch that was validated by users but never merged into `master` has been properly integrated.
